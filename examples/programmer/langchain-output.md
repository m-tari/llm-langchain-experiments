Observation: 
Thought:Let's test the calculator functions before saving them to a file.

Observation: Invalid or incomplete response
Thought:It seems like there was an error in the previous action. Let me try running the actions separately.
Action:
```
{
  "action": "Python REPL",
  "action_input": "with open('calculator.py', 'w') as f:\n    f.write('''\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n    return a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return 'Cannot divide by zero'\n    return a / b\n''')"
}
```


Observation: 
Thought:Now that the calculator code is saved in the current directory, let's test it with some inputs and save the results to a file.
Action:
```
{
  "action": "Python REPL",
  "action_input": "from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n\nwith open('tests.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(str(add(2, 3)) + '\\n')\n    f.write(str(subtract(5, 2)) + '\\n')\n    f.write(str(multiply(4, 6)) + '\\n')\n    f.write(str(divide(10, 2)) + '\\n')\n    f.write(str(divide(10, 0)) + '\\n')"
}
```


Observation: 
Thought:Now that the tests have been saved to the file, let's print out the results to make sure everything is working correctly.
Action:
```
{
  "action": "Python REPL",
  "action_input": "with open('tests.txt', 'r') as f:\n    print(f.read())"
}

Cannot divide by zero


The calculator functions are working correctly and the tests have been saved to the file. Let's provide the final response to the human.
Action:
```
{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "The calculator code has been saved in the current directory as calculator.py. The tests have been run and the results have been saved in tests.txt."
}
```
