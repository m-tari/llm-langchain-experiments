## Experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Langchain framework.

The advent of Large Language Models with impressive abilities has made all of us
super excited. It seems that building a machine with the ability to talk like a 
human was easier to solve than what we thought. But what if we use the LLM as 
the brain of a system that can act autonomously? How can we make them reliable for
tasks that need decision-making in a vague environment? What solutions they can 
find that were not predicted by us before?

This repository is inspired by recent research results such as [Voyager: An Open-Ended 
Embodied Agent with Large Language Models](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager).
